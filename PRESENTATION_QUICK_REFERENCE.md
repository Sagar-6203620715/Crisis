## **‚ùì ANTICIPATED Q&A RESPONSES**

**Q: How do you prevent fake reports?**
A: "3 verified reporters must approve each report. We build a trusted network with blockchain-based reputation."

**Q: What if IPFS nodes go down?**
A: "Multiple gateway fallbacks ensure data accessibility. The decentralized nature provides redundancy."

**Q: How do you verify reporters?**
A: "Initial verification by contract owner, then community-driven reputation building through successful verifications."

**Q: What about gas costs?**
A: "Gas-optimized contracts minimize costs. During crises, the value of verified information far exceeds gas expenses."

**Q: How do you handle emergencies without internet?**
A: "This is for coordination when systems are available. Offline protocols would be a future enhancement."
